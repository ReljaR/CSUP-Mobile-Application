University of Donja Gorica - Case Study, "Application for checking available seats in a caffe"

### Project Overview

This idea is one that i had for some time in my head, but haven't had the time to realize it. The point is to make life easier for the customer, to save their time and money by helping them find a free spot at a coffee shop in seconds, without the need to get to a place and check when they arrive. Most of the pages in the application are for the customer, but also on the other side there is a page for a certain coffee shop, where a waitor would keep track of said free seats. There would be a login screen so every waitor could log in and keep track, also there would be an option for a user to make an account for themselves to keep track of places they go easier. In order to find a place to check, a customer would need to enter the coffee shop name which would pull out a coffe shops profile with a few details about them for the intrest of the customer and a number of free seats of course. In order to make things a bit more easier or intresting, the app should have a page with google maps. That way you can just check what exactly is there in the part of the town you are going to and what to look for.

I have a few more ideas, one of them is reserving seats. But that is something i am still considering and am not sure if it would be a good idea to add or not.
